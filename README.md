## Create 3 Standard Queues

Create 3 Standard Queues
* QueueA "https://sqs.us-2.amazonaws.com/..../messageQueueA"
* QueueB "https://sqs.us-2.amazonaws.com/..../messageQueueB"
* QueueC "https://sqs.us-2.amazonaws.com/..../messageQueueC"



LAB: SQS & Lambda

* Create Lambda functions that are triggered by each of the 3 Queues
* Write your functions in Javascript
* They should perform the same task that your Java apps do
* Confirm that as you publish, you are seeing your app and the lambdas handle the 
    queued messages at scale
